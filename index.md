Night & Day is a 2D local co-op puzzle game. It features many unique levels with different obstacles, from jumping over spikes to moving saw's and platforms! Sleek looking User-Interface, relaxing puzzle solving music both ingame and in menus. This game was made in a 8 day period during Unity education at PISMO Novska. It's a part of our course on Unity, specifially project managing! The theme was "Day and Night".
